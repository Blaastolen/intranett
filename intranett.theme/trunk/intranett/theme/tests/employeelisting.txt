General Employee listing
------------------------

Get us a test browser, logged in as a normal user:

  >>> browser = self.getBrowser()
  >>> browser.handleErrors = False
  >>> browser.open('http://nohost/plone/employee-listing')

If a user has no portrait, the view doesn't blow up and the user gets standard portrait fallback:

  

Only users with 'Manage users' permission can see "manage" link for a user
  
Department employee listing
---------------------------

2. We get poralMessage with the number of department employees
3. the current department is selected in the bar
4. The number of department employees is correct
5. If we are in a department we should see 'show all' link
6. If there are users without a department we should get 'unspecified' in the bar in order to edit those users
