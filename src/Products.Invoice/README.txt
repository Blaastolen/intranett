Introduction
============

A basic Plone content type representing an invoice. Useful for small companies
and organizations without their own internal accounting systems

We made this product to cover our own need. It complies with all necessary
standards for Norwegian invoices. We'd like it to be usable for as many
countries as possible, but not to have special condition for every country in
the world. Feel free to add *generic* fields and modifications that make the
invoice usable as many places as possible, but not locking it to your standard.
